# ContextualChat
ContextualChat launches an XMPP MUC web chat (actually jcbrand/converse.js at https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js) with a predefined topic according to the context. Instead usually people launches a chat by choosing a contact or MUC (group chat room) at first without context.  A LIVE demo is at https://bizchat.us/roledemo/index.html. BTW, this is a side product of my Hotline.Chat project.
