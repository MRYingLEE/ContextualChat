# ContextualChat
As a web chat demo, ContextualChat launches an XMPP MUC web chat (actually jcbrand/converse.js at https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js) with a predefined topic according to the context. Instead usually people launches a chat by choosing a contact or MUC (group chat room) at first without context. BTW, this is a side product of my Hotline.Chat project.

## LIVE Demo
A LIVE demo is at https://bizchat.us/roledemo/index.html.

## Usage
1. This demo uses jcbrand/converse.js (https://github.com/jcbrand/converse.js), but the method should work with other XMPP Web Chat also, such as Jappix Mini (https://github.com/jappix/jappix).
2. This is only a simple demo. You may use the method and source code in your way.


## SERVER SIDE
ContextualChat works with any standard XMPP server.

To support a live support/help usage, you need an XMPP server to support role chat. One example is XMPP-RoleChat.
